<h1 id="techniques">Techniques</h1>
<p>Techniques describe the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals. They represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action.
For example, an adversary may gain initial access by compromising the machine learning (ML) supply chain.</p>
<p>Techniques may also represent “what” an adversary gains by performing an action. This is a useful distinction for the ML Attack Staging tactic,
where the adversary is typically creating or modifying an ML artifact that will be used in a subsequent tactical objective.
There can be multiple techniques in each tactic category as there are many ways to achieve tactical objectives.

<td align="left"><a href="AML.T0000.html">Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials</a></td>
<td align="left">Adversaries may search publicly available research to learn how and where machine learning is used within a victim organization. The adversary can use this information to identify targets for attack, or to tailor an existing attack to make it more effective. Organizations often use open source model architectures trained on additional proprietary data in production. Knowledge of this underlying architecture allows the adversary to craft more realistic proxy models (<a href="AML.T0005.html">Create Proxy ML Model</a>). An adversary can search these resources for publications for authors employed at the victim organization.  Research materials may exist as academic papers published in <a href="AML.T0000.000.html">Journals and Conference Proceedings</a>, or stored in <a href="AML.T0000.001.html">Pre-Print Repositories</a>, as well as <a href="AML.T0000.002.html">Technical Blogs</a>.</td>

<td align="left">Many of the publications accepted at premier machine learning conferences and journals come from commercial labs. Some journals and conferences are open access, others may require paying for access or a membership. These publications will often describe in detail all aspects of a particular approach for reproducibility. This information can be used by adversaries to implement the paper.</td>

<td align="left">Pre-Print repositories, such as arXiv, contain the latest academic research papers that haven't been peer reviewed. They may contain research notes, or technical reports that aren't typically published in journals or conference proceedings. Pre-print repositories also serve as a central location to share papers that have been accepted to journals. Searching pre-print repositories  provide adversaries with a relatively up-to-date view of what researchers in the victim organization are working on.</td>

<td align="left">Research labs at academic institutions and Company R&amp;D divisions often have blogs that highlight their use of machine learning and its application to the organizations unique problems. Individual researchers also frequently document their work in blogposts. An adversary may search for posts made by the target victim organization or its employees. In comparison to <a href="AML.T0000.000.html">Journals and Conference Proceedings</a> and <a href="AML.T0000.001.html">Pre-Print Repositories</a> this material will often contain more practical aspects of the machine learning system. This could include underlying technologies and frameworks used, and possibly some information about the API access and use case. This will help the adversary better understand how that organization is using machine learning internally and the details of their approach that could aid in tailoring an attack.</td>

<td align="left">Much like the <a href="AML.T0000.html">Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials</a>, there is often ample research available on the vulnerabilities of common models. Once a target has been identified, an adversary will likely try to identify any pre-existing work that has been done for this class of models. This will include not only reading academic papers that may identify the particulars of a successful attack, but also identifying pre-existing implementations of those attacks. The adversary may <a href="AML.T0016.000.html">Adversarial ML Attack Implementations</a> or <a href="AML.T0017.html">Develop Adversarial ML Attack Capabilities</a> their own if necessary.</td>

Victim-owned websites may contain technical details about their ML-enabled products or services. Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info. These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.  Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information. This information may help adversaries tailor their attacks (e.g. <a href="AML.T0017.html">Develop Adversarial ML Attack Capabilities</a> or <a href="AML.T0043.003.html">Manual Modification</a>). Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (e.g. <a href="AML.T0000.html">Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials</a> or <a href="AML.T0001.html">Search for Publicly Available Adversarial Vulnerability Analysis</a>)</td>

<td align="left">Adversaries may search public sources, including cloud storage, public-facing services, and software or data repositories, to identify machine learning artifacts. These machine learning artifacts may include the software stack used to train and deploy models, training and testing data, model configurations and parameters. An adversary will be particularly interested in artifacts hosted by or associated with the victim organization as they may represent what that organization uses in a production environment. Adversaries may identify artifact repositories via other resources associated with the victim organization (e.g. <a href="AML.T0003.html">Search Victim-Owned Websites</a> or <a href="AML.T0000.html">Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials</a>). These ML artifacts often provide adversaries with details of the ML task and approach.  ML artifacts can aid in an adversary's ability to <a href="AML.T0005.html">Create Proxy ML Model</a>. If these artifacts include pieces of the actual model in production, they can be used to directly <a href="AML.T0043.html">Craft Adversarial Data</a>. Acquiring some artifacts requires registration (providing user details such email/name), AWS keys, or written requests, and may require the adversary to <a href="AML.T0021.html">Establish Accounts</a>.  Artifacts might be hosted on victim-controlled infrastructure, providing the victim with some information on who has accessed that data.</td>

Datasets can be stored in cloud storage, or on victim-owned websites. Some datasets require the adversary to <a href="AML.T0021.html">Establish Accounts</a> for access.

Representative models may include model architectures, or pre-trained models which define the architecture as well as model parameters from training on a dataset. The adversary may search public sources for common model architecture configuration file formats such as yaml or python configuration files, and common model storage file formats such as ONNX (.onnx), HDF5 (.h5), Pickle (.pkl), PyTorch (.pth), or TensorFlow (.pb, .tflite).

<td align="left"><a href="AML.T0043.001.html">Black-Box Optimization</a></td>
<td align="left">In Black-Box attacks, the adversary has black-box (i.e. <a href="AML.T0040.html">ML Model Inference API Access</a> via API access) access to the target model. With black-box attacks, the adversary may be using an API that the victim is monitoring. These attacks are generally less effective and require more inferences than <a href="AML.T0043.000.html">White-Box Optimization</a> attacks, but they require much less access.</td>

<td align="left"><a href="AML.T0043.002.html">Black-Box Transfer</a></td>
<td align="left">In Black-Box Transfer attacks, the adversary uses one or more proxy models (trained via <a href="AML.T0005.html">Create Proxy ML Model</a> or <a href="AML.T0005.001.html">Train Proxy via Replication</a>) models they have full access to and are representative of the target model. The adversary uses <a href="AML.T0043.000.html">White-Box Optimization</a> on the proxy models to generate adversarial examples. If the set of proxy models are close enough to the target model, the adversarial example should generalize from one to another. This means that an attack that works for the proxy models will likely then work for the target model. If the adversary has <a href="AML.T0040.html">ML Model Inference API Access</a>, they may use this <a href="AML.T0042.html">Verify Attack</a> that the attack is working and incorporate that information into their training process.</td>

<td align="left">Adversaries may manually modify the input data to craft adversarial data. They may use their knowledge of the target model to modify parts of the data they suspect helps the model in performing its task. The adversary may use trial and error until they are able to verify they have a working adversarial input.</td>

<td align="left">The adversary may add a perceptual trigger into inference data. The trigger may be imperceptible or non-obvious to humans. This technique is used in conjunction with <a href="AML.T0018.000.html">Poison ML Model</a> and allows the adversary to produce their desired effect in the target model.</td>

<td align="left">Adversaries may exfiltrate ML artifacts to steal intellectual property and cause economic harm to the victim organization.  Proprietary training data is costly to collect and annotate and may be a target for <a href="/tactics/AML.TA0010">Exfiltration</a> and theft.  MLaaS providers charge for use of their API. An adversary who has stolen a model via <a href="/tactics/AML.TA0010">Exfiltration</a> or via <a href="AML.T0024.002.html">Extract ML Model</a> now has unlimited use of that service without paying the owner of the intellectual property.</td>
